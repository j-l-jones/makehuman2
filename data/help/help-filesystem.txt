<h1>Makehuman2 File System</h1>
<p>
Makehuman uses two locations to read or write data. The system location, which is where the program is installed and
a user location which can be changed in preferences (a later change will demand to move the data as well).
Both locations are checked, when files need to be loaded. User location is checked before system location, so it is possible to
replace files.
<p>
The data is organized in different asset categories (like clothes and hair), then a mesh sub-directory is the next layer, except for those cases,
where the mesh does not make sense.

<h2>Base meshes in User Space</h2>
<p>
To achieve higher flexibility and to add user created base meshes including own targets, it is also possible to do that in user space.
<p>
In this case the targets and all JSON files (target_cat.json, modelling.json) must be created manually in <b>contarget</b> folder (used for "constant targets").
This folder will be used instead of system target folder, which will be ignored then.
Additional targets then should be placed in the normal user target folder,
since a modelling.json file in that folder is generated automatically and would overwrite any manually created file.
